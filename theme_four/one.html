	<h1>Why She Stayed</h1>
	<p>And before<br>
	you ask her<br>
	why she stayed,<br>
	look at the way<br>
	a <span2>caged</span2> bird<br>
	sometimes<br>
	refuses to <span1>leave</span1>,<br>
	even when<br>
	its <span2>cage</span2> door<br>
	is wide open.<br>
	Even when<br>
	you call it<br>
	softly.<br>
	Even when you<br>
	try to take it<br>
	out of its <span2>prison</span2><br>
	to set it <span1>free</span1>.
	<p>And perhaps then you will understand.</p>
