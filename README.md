# Remix Typography Project
## A Project for Data as Material taken at Parsons School of Design
### [Live Project](https://isabelstoddart.github.io/Remix/)

This project consisted of 15 changes to the poem Why She Stayed by Nikita Gill. The changes fell within 5 themes: Opposites, Space, Color, Font, and Accessibility. The original structure and spacing of the poem is used and kept consistent for each iteration of the project. 

### Opposites
The Opposites theme explores the deeper meaning of the poem and what happens when the meaning is flipped by using opposites of the original words. 

### Space
Space looks at restructuring the original poem to see if a change in meaning occurs and taking out stop words to create white space and draw attention to the most important aspects of the poem.

### Color
Color plays with using the contrast between black and white to highlight major points in the poem. One part of color used a program called Colorize. Colorize is a website that turns any word or phrase into a hex color. It uses a search engine to find image results for the word and finds the average color across the approximately 25 image results. For this part using Colorize, each word of the poem is set to its respective color. 

### Font
Font uses a warm font and a dark font to highlight the opposites apparent in the meaning of the poem. Words like prison are shown in the warm font and words like free are shown in the dark font to symbolize the comfort the bird finds in being caged and its fear of being free.

### Accessibility
Accessibility explores drawing attention to the underlying meaning of the poem, Domestic Abuse.
