	<h1>Why She Left</h1>
	<p>And after<br>
	you ask her<br>
	why she left,<br>
	look at the way<br>
	a free bird<br>
	sometimes<br>
	refuses to stay,<br>
	even when<br>
	its cage door<br>
	is closed.<br>
	Even when<br>
	you call it<br>
	loudly.<br>
	Even when you<br>
	try to keep it<br>
	in its prison<br>
	to hold it hostage.
	<p>And perhaps then you will understand.</p>
