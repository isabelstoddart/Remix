	<h1>Why He Stayed</h1>
	<p>And before<br>
	you ask him<br>
	why he stayed,<br>
	look at the way<br>
	a caged bird<br>
	sometimes<br>
	refuses to leave,<br>
	even when<br>
	its cage door<br>
	is wide open.<br>
	Even when<br>
	you call it<br>
	softly.<br>
	Even when you<br>
	try to take it<br>
	out of its prison<br>
	to set it free.
	<p>And perhaps then you will understand.</p>
