	<h1><span>Why She Stayed</span> Why They Did It</h1>
	<p>And before<br>
	you ask her<br>
	why she stayed,<br>
	<span>look at the way<br>
	a caged bird<br>
	sometimes<br>
	refuses to leave,<br>
	even when<br>
	its cage door<br>
	is wide open<br>
	Even when<br>
	you call it<br>
	softly.<br>
	Even when you<br>
	try to take it<br>
	out of its prison<br>
	to set it free.</span><br>
	Ask why they did it.
	<p>And perhaps then you will understand.</p>
