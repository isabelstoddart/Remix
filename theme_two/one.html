	<h1>Why She Stayed</h1>
	<p>And before<br>
	you ask her<br>
	why she stayed,<br>
	look at the way<br>
	a caged bird<br>
	sometimes<br>
	refuses to leave,<br>
	even when<br>
	its cage door<br>
	is wide open<br>
	Even when<br>
	you call it<br>
	softly.<br>
	Even when you<br>
	try to take it<br>
	out of its prison<br>
	to set <span1>it free.</span1>
	<p>And perhaps then you will understand.</p>
